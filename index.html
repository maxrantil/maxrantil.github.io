      <strong>Profile</strong>:
      I am Max Rantil, a dedicated and resilient software developer from Sweden, currently based in Helsinki, Finland. I
      am a Hive Helsinki graduate, where I honed my skills in various programming languages and developed a deep
      understanding of secure and reliable application development. My educational journey was marked by a significant
      leadership role, where I led a diverse team to design and implement a complex shell application. This experience
      not only showcased my ability to coordinate group efforts and meet project deadlines, but also highlighted my
      problem-solving abilities and commitment to quality standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond technical skills, I bring a collaborative spirit and a positive attitude to all my professional
      engagements. I am known for my adaptability and my ability to align my approach to individual needs, a skill that
      has been crucial in roles requiring understanding and addressing diverse perspectives and requirements. I am also
      a proactive individual, always ready to take the initiative and carry out tasks independently when necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a strong passion for continuous learning and I am always on the lookout for opportunities to expand my
      knowledge, particularly in emerging technologies. My goal is to leverage my skills and experiences to make a
      significant contribution to a dynamic software development team. I am excited about the possibility of bringing my
      unique blend of skills and experiences to create impactful solutions in the tech industry.

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/maxrantil/42sh">Shell Creation Project</a>:
      In this project, I developed a POSIX-compliant shell from scratch.
      This was a challenging task that required a deep understanding of Unix and POSIX functionalities,
      including command execution, environment management, and interaction with shell variables.
      I used C programming language for this project, and it helped me to improve my skills in system and network
      administration,
      project management, and building complex systems.
      The final product was a robust shell interpreter, 42sh, that supports a broad spectrum of UNIX and POSIX
      functionalities.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/maxrantil/roger-skyline-1">Roger-Skyline-1</a>:
      This project involved setting up a Linux-based server on a virtual machine, configuring system settings,
      and installing the Artix operating system. Key tasks included establishing a secure shell (SSH),
      configuring a firewall, implementing Fail2Ban, and setting up an Apache web server.
      I also developed scripts for regular package updates and crontab monitoring, configured a local mail server,
      and set up a static IP. This project showcased my skills in server setup, network administration, and security
      measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/maxrantil/ft_printf">ft_printf</a>:
      The ft_printf project involved recreating the printf function in C using a limited set of built-in C Library
      functions.
      The recreated function, ft_printf, supports various conversion specifiers, flags, field widths, precisions,
      and length modifiers. This project served as a valuable exercise in understanding variadic functions in C
      and provided a practical example of a basic "dispatcher" in C. It showcased my skills in working with low-level
      functions,
      memory management, and complex function creation in C.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/maxrantil/game-of-life">Game of Life</a>:
      The Game of Life project involved implementing Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton,
      with an emphasis on optimizing the performance. The game operates on a two-dimensional grid of cells,
      each transitioning between states based on its neighbors. In this group project we incorporated significant
      optimizations,
      such as halting iterations upon detecting repeating patterns, using bitwise operations for efficient state checks
      and predictions.
      Additionally, we developed an interactive graphical user interface for the game, enhancing user engagement.
      This project highlighted my skills in algorithm optimization, bitwise operations, and GUI development.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/maxrantil/ft_ls">ft_ls</a>:
      The ft_ls project involved recreating the Unix 'ls' command, providing a deep dive into Unix file systems,
      file permissions, and metadata. My version, ft_ls, supports options like long format listing, recursive listing,
      hidden files inclusion, file order reversal, and sorting by modification time.
      This project highlighted my proficiency in C programming, understanding of Unix systems,
      and ability to handle complex data structures and system functions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/maxrantil/libft">libft</a>:
      The Libft project was a foundational project in the 42 curriculum, requiring us to recreate several standard C
      library functions from scratch.
      The project served as an introduction to C programming, emphasizing the understanding of data types, control
      structures,
      and basic algorithms. The recreated library, libft, includes a variety of functions, such as those for string
      manipulation, memory allocation, and character checks, as well as more complex data structures like linked lists.
      This project was instrumental in honing my skills in C programming, memory management, and algorithm
      implementation, setting the stage for more advanced projects in the curriculum.
